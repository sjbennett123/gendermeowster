title: How to Run Mutual Aid Streams
---

 - Having a visible goal on stream helps a lot. I like pally.gg because you can mix manually added cash donations with transactions on the pally platform. The developer is also super responsive and makes updates regularly.  
 - Advertise the stream heavily leading up to and during it. Post on socials. In discord servers. A lot of communities don‚Äôt let you post direct donate links but allow stream posts, so if you‚Äôre promoting a stream, hooray! 
 - It can be powerful to have multiple people stream for 2-3 hours than one person doing a super long stream, because each time someone goes live, it pings a different community‚Äôs notifications. Harnessing the power of community is rad! 
 - Ask videos are a must - have a pre-recorded video by the recipient explaining the situation, how it can be permanently improved by a fixed amount, and directly asking the audience to give, then ending with thank yous. I also suggest a separate thank you video to play at the end.  
 - Each streamer can play the ask video at the beginning of their stream and after any surprise/additional raids into the channel.  
 - if you are having a multi-day raid train (I organize 3-4 a year, it‚Äôs totally fun and totally exhausting), it can be nice to have a ‚Äúclosing ceremony‚Äù on a special channel at the end of the event. Have the recipient make a live appearance, do thank yous for everyone that showed up and participated, etc.  I hope this helps! Gender Federation puts on events like this near-quarterly, check out the linktree for socials and mailing lists etc to learn more about that group. https://linktr.ee/GenderFederation

## Tips and Tricks for Surviving a Multi-Day Event

It‚Äôs very important to us that you all take care of yourselves. We know that even for those of you who are only viewers (which is SO very helpful) it can be easy to get sucked into the fun and chaos. Even more so for everyone streaming or admining in multiple slots. So here are some tips to take care of yourselves:

- Pre-prep food ahead of time where possible.
- At bedtime, have things to help your brain calm down from the event so sleep can happen mid-event.
- Plan sleep times (and try to stick to them) if that‚Äôs helpful to you. Remember VODs exist so streams can be watched later and highlight reel will be on the finale stream and on YouTube after.
- Make sure that you hydrate, and keep water (or hydration of choice) within easy reach.
- Keep meds you might need within easy reach, perhaps even fill your pill boxes early if you use those.
- Take standing and stretch breaks.
- If you live with other people/ people who might reach out - let them know what is going on this weekend in case you‚Äôre less available than usual. (and hey, maybe they can join in the watching!)
- Set alarms for basic tasks (bathroom, meds, water, food, stretch)
- If the streamer takes a break, take a break yourself!
- Remind your fellow participants to take care of themselves as well.
- Be kind to yourself - take breaks as needed!

## before the event steps

General reminder - folks might want to physically prepare for this weekend by:

- doing food prep, grocery shopping, etc
- letting family/ roommates/ friends know what you're up to this weekend and how available you might be (if you want to swap or hand off chores, for example)
- making sure your meds are restocked
- charging your devices
- setting up desk/ space you're planning to watch the event (finally unpack that monitor or mouse or whatever, if applicable).

## Meowster Mutual Aid Begins in 5 hours!

The event is SO close! @Event Participant @Event Admin, time to make sure you‚Äôre prepped for whatever role(s) you may have, you‚Äôre ready to sit down for a loooong watch, and you‚Äôve shared all about this event!

## Promote Promote Promote!

Share this event! Retweet your slots, skeet your involvement, share on your preferred social media platform. Meowster has found 1-1 texts to be highly effective, if you‚Äôve any pals you‚Äôd like to text or DM about the event. Tell your friends, your neighbors, and your cats. 

Reminder that we have ‚Å†Gender Federation‚Å†socials-boost-event - please share your socials posts in there and check other‚Äôs each day of the event. Comments, likes, shares are all very useful to boost the visibility. Don‚Äôt forget to include #MeowsterMutualAid on all of your posts, and take a few minutes to search and engage with that hashtag on your platform of choice.

Some key things to share might be the Ask Video, the donate link, and the full schedule posts on the socials of your choice.

## Streamer Setups

A few quick things for setting up your stream:

Double check the original Streamer Checklist to make sure you have all the newly added mods sworded. Please check the list linked in this bullet point rather than your own copy.

The suggested stream title in the checklist was missing some info and was too long. It‚Äôs now been corrected, and here‚Äôs the new suggested title:

We want to make sure that we thank the people who help keep you safe! Please list your mods for the event in our Thank You Document in the appropriate spot.

## All the Clips

Clips for the Clip God! 

Help the tired admins and the wonderful streamers by clipping fun moments!

Streamers, you can make it easy by setting up a clip command! Instructions here.

Once clips exist, make sure to put the links in the thread for that streamer in the ‚Å†Gender Federation‚Å†‚ú®clips-from-event channel.

React to your favorite clips with the ‚≠ê so that the highlight reel is the best of the best!

## Viewers wanted

We need people to watch the clips as they come in and star the ones you like the most! Please react to this message with üëÄ if you are up for keeping an eye on clips. This should really be a lot of fun, clips will be amazing parts of streams. @Donation Tracker who are off duty are especially welcomed to help with this as well, since it‚Äôs a low tech job. We just need people who will do it as Stage Managers are too busy to do so ourselves. Thank you!

## Mods Needed

Hey @Twitch Mods (Event), some streamers could still use help. Please check ‚Å†Gender Federation‚Å†‚ú®twitch-mods and see if you can mod for any of them. Thank you!

## THANK YOU

We can‚Äôt do this without all of you. Organizers, admin, streamers, mods, viewers, and even lurkers. Thank you all SO much for being part of this. Now let‚Äôs go and make this an AMAZING event! :transgengar:

 

## Mailing List and Socials

Please take a few moments to make sure that you are [subscribed to our email list](https://mailchi.mp/c0dfe546a4fe/e-newsletter) and double check if you‚Äôre [following our socials](https://linktr.ee/genderfederation). We use the email list to do some of our most important communications and invitations, and engaging and participating with our YouTube channel and socials will help drive engagement with our events. Even if you have no money to contribute, commenting on, sharing, and especially directly texting/sharing about the event with your friends and loved ones is an incredible way to make a huge impact in our recipient‚Äôs ability to reach their goals!

# Event Feedback

Stars (what went well), wishes (what could go better), and comments/ideas for the future. Thank you for participating and thank you for taking time to give us feedback to improve our processes. 

**Name**/Handle and Pronouns (please include if we have follow up questions, it's not required in case you need to do anon feedback)

**Stars**: What went well, what positive things do you have to say about the event?

**Wishes**: what could we do better, what are improvements to the process we can implement next time?

**Incentives**: if you're a streamer or saw streams: What incentives did you or a streamer use to drive donations - what was effective? (we are always looking for creative gimmicks for this sort of stuff!)

**Return**: Would you like to be involved/invited to future events? What kinds of roles would you like to have? (streamer, mod, graphic designer, social media poster, admin including things like transaction tracking, scene swapping for the schedule stream, and streamer wrangling)

Other **comments**? Questions? Concerns? Offers? Thank you for participating!

## Streamer Tips

- Perhaps allocate 3 hours of prep time with the streamer checklist, and remember that you can make a copy, check stuff off, and ask clarifying questions in ‚Å†‚ùìevent-questions
-  consider getting a cohost that anchors personal incentives/ milestones and reads chat for you while you focus on content.
-  put an individual goal tracking on screen if you can, there are guides in the server FAQ by sunberry about how to do it (link it here)
-  reminder to use captions on your stream for accessibility.
-  remind streamers they need to go live 15 mins before their slot, we've had a few folks already who have left it late

   

## Giveaways

I‚Äôve gotten this question a couple of times - streamers are absolutely allowed to enter event giveaways while their stream is live. We are all collectively working on keeping our viewership up and raising money, so it‚Äôs only fair that we all get chances at the prizes! Please use discretion with entering milestone giveaways you personally set for your own channel (example: don‚Äôt enter a giveaway just so you don‚Äôt have to ship an item later you planned as a milestone, for example - but you can still enter for your friends).  Entering giveaways to win prizes that you‚Äôll regift to friends is also allowed - this drives chat engagement and also may be a reason to reach out to someone to invite them to join the stream. Maybe a game you know a friend who isn‚Äôt on the train would enjoy is being raffled, you go DM them, they join for the prize, but stay for the event because of the vibes. It‚Äôs a valid and genuinely fun way to build up viewership - get organized! Be a hooligan! **This is trans joy for trans liberation!!!**
   
   

 tip: Keep a set of tabs open so that you can switch between them easily.


Sunday (Event Day 4/Finale) - Participant Announcement
FINAL DAY AAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!

Streamers
Clip reviews
We're trying out best to collect clips and star them for the starboard.  If you and your mods could pop in after stream, to help star some of these clips to let us know which moments reflect you and your community best (or not! üòÑ ).  Also, please consider going back on your stream to make clips if you remember a good bit.

Pally GG Activity dock
If you haven't already linked your PallyGG account to the Gender Federation account to access the activity dock, you will need a new signup link, as the old one expired - https://pally.gg/join?invite-code=noxqg2fulv9b03t80mgml5f5

Tips from other Streamers
Perhaps allocate 3 hours of prep time with the streamer checklist, and remember that you can make a copy, check stuff off, and ask clarifying questions in ‚Å†‚ùìevent-questions
Consider getting a cohost that anchors personal incentives/ milestones and reads chat for you while you focus on content.
Put an individual goal tracking on screen if you can, there are guides in the [streamer FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lwGDaFUnjT2N2dnb646H7cnajfGgYxQ6h9Si2SusRII/edit#heading=h.3x4nbyg185ft) by sunberry about how to do it
Reminder to use captions on your stream for accessibility.

Donation Tracking with MixItUp
Sunberry wrote a guide for MixitUp to track your personal donations in twitch chat https://docs.google.com/document/d/10_9or-xtbdIvXHXiOrPgBIDqiuEpmvo0AeSjYEOEH-M/edit?usp=sharing

Event Twitch Mod (2 types)
Focus: Security and Socializing/Hype Building
Twitch Mods ensure that the streamers - who may have an above average viewership during the event - have adequate moderation containers appropriate for marginalized communities. They may help local mods with event commands and process ban reports to Aegis.
Security (Event Twitch Mod 1)
Keep an eye on chat, watch for trolls (primary)
Make sure you stay and watch the chat during streamer‚Äôs breaks
Send reports to Aegis when bans are actioned
Make sure next streamers are ready/online before the raids (can coordinate with mods).

Socializing/Hype Building (Event Twitch Mod 2)
Chat with streamer and keep them company/build hype for event

Possibly has ‚Äúeditor‚Äù access to clips to support content editors in getting source material that is high quality by downloading stream clips and uploading to google drive (or the Team NAS/storage once it‚Äôs a thing).
Try to get a clip of each major milestone we hit on stream (any time we get a multiple of $1,000 for example, or a meme number like $420.69 or $6,969.69).
Makes sure the streamer‚Äôs local mods know any event commands (in case the streamer forgot).
Backup for security mod if there‚Äôs a hate raid.

Helpful if you can also check streamer‚Äôs go-lives for them
reports trolls
(more stuff, ask dominick)
Stage Manager
Focuses: Schedule Managing and Fundraising
Stage Managers drive donations by communicating incentives and milestones to the streamer and audience via the Twitch chat, sometimes even by using the /announce command in chat. (This command requires being a mod, possibly editor, for that channel)

Point person during the event to make sure things are going smoothly, holds multiple tasks, can delegate as needed.

Schedule Managing
Anchor staff voice chat, hopefully with at least one other experienced event producer.
On the hour, during the raid, amend the stream title on GF channel to have the current streamers handle as well as update the GF StreamElements graphic
Remind streamers to play the ask video within the first 20 mins of a new stream.
Reminder each 30 minutes from the hour to run the hourly game code giveaway. (Donation Trackers record the winner, not Stage Managers).
Remind streamers to play Thank you vid last in last 10 mins
Fundraising
Track the Overall Event Milestones (i.e. emote giveaways, portraits, gift cards - the ‚Äúbigger prizes‚Äù), announce in the chats our progress on this e.g.: /announcegreen We are currently at $_ | Next milestone giveaway is at $_ in $_!!.
DMs or whispers game codes to winners, takes note of when these are not immediately fulfilled.
Posts about milestones in the chat to encourage folks to donate with updates (about leaderboard, next incentive/how much more until next milestone, etc).
Streamer
Streamers host content and are a big part of the ‚Äúface‚Äù of the event. They have their own, event specific FAQ. Here is a somewhat generic one, but always look for updated event FAQs if you‚Äôre trying to reference beyond general duties.

Streamer Co-Host 
Focuses: Streamer Support
Streamer Co-Hosts are the bridge between the streamer and the stage manager/chat. 
Joins the streamer through audio and/or video, so at least their voice will be on stream.
Keeps watch on time to help keep the streamer on track for ask/thank you videos, for giveaways, etc.
Reads chat to the streamer so streamer can interact while still being able to focus on their game/activity.
Makes sure that the streamer is aware of any announcements from the stage manager.
Makes sure the streamer is aware of any announcements from the streamer support donation tracker.
Helps Streamer keep track of their own individual incentive and milestones and amount raised in their stream




FAQ for Mutual Aid Organizers
Streamer Wranglers
What to do if someone drops out or needs to change shifts after the schedule is set?
check back to the streamer schedule and see who was willing to do multiple streams and was available to stream during the slot that streamer now cannot make. When considering streamers, keep in mind if it is anyone‚Äôs normal time, how much draw each streamer has, who would be best for the spot fundraising wise. 
If there is a streamer that fits, reach out to see if they are still willing to sub in for the slot. If no one is available, work with additional event admin to reach out to former event streamers, friends, etc. Once you have a replacement, ensure you notify the graphic design and social media teams asap of the change.
Organizing the change between streamer wranglers:
In the streamer wranglers channel, make a thread for that streamer/time slot. 
Make sure any efforts done to replace the streamer is logged there (DMing other streamers, responses, etc)
What is Aegis?
Aegis (ahead of time, optional and strongly encouraged) 
Streams and their mods can consider signing up for Aegis: https://www.aegis.report/  
Aegis provides security for LGBTQIA+ safe spaces on Discord as well as content creators on Twitch seeking to protect their community. Servers and creators within Aegis help stop the flood of anti-LGBT trolls, bad actors, and hate raids. Aegis also provides space for streamers and Discord teams to meet, collaborate, plan events, exchange ideas, look for experienced mods, train new mods, and so much more.
The more 2SLGBTQIAPP+ friendly communities in Aegis, the safer we all become.
Best practices for inviting folks to stream for the event?
Any @Event Admin who wants to invite folks, here are some things to keep in mind:
Direct invites are WAY more effective than generalized posts in servers. 
Please be mindful of where things are shared since the server invite is part of the message and we don't have a robust mod container for this internal server. 
We prefer to have streamers who are gender diverse and I am very selective about the cis allies we will have on the raid trains. If you're inviting someone cisgender, please make sure you'd be comfy doing a personal vouch for them.
Please track your efforts on our event invite tracking sheet so we don't invite someone multiple times and we can follow up appropriately. Let GenderMeowster me know if you are doing invites and don't have edit access to the sheet.
3) Please use the invite scripts for DMs and emails document instead of "winging it" - there's a lot of important info we may not send in a concentrated way otherwise.
Example responses to sign up concerns/questions
When is the deadline?
We are accepting sign ups until two weeks before the event.
Concern: those two days don't work
Thanks for writing back! It's looking like the longer version of the event (Thursday through Sunday) is becoming more likely since we have 9 folks already signed up, and we have a chance to get the 25 folks we would need to do the longer event. If that makes it more of an option for you, please feel free to fill out the form! Otherwise, I appreciate the other support and have a great time zone. <3
Concern: small audience
I hear ya. <3 This event may end up being like 4 days long, so you are more likely to get folks from outside of your community that are part of the train and wanting to support/participate. Sometimes with these events there comes a point where we just need willing folks to support and keep it all going. <3 If you're interested, I'd love to have you sign up anyways!
Concern: busy during set up period
I'm hoping most of the documentation to set up is fairly self explanatory. I may host a streamer info session in 2 weekends so folks can learn more in real time and ask questions. There are also some folks around that have done a couple of these, so asynchronous questions in the server will work well too. I'm excited to work together!
Concern: Spoons/Energy/Disabled
One thing I've learned as a spoonie (if you'd like to hear it) is the value of having someone join/support you on stream. For example, I'm having my mom join me for tarot on my stream so we can both carry the content. I've also been known to have a friend help with producing big events - like for TDOR this year, Ray produced, Kaemsi ran the slide deck, I hosted, and 10-12 others did the reading of the names. Making it a community project makes it more sustainable for me as a spoonie. <3
Response: I can't make it but I'll spread the word
If you'd be interested in future stuff we're getting up to, feel free to join the server anyways. And if you want social media boost pings in a dedicated channel, snag the "event participant" and "Social media booster" roles.

If that's too many things, just keep an eye out for the hashtag. :) 

Here is our linktree if you'd like to follow the team's socials: <https://linktr.ee/genderfederation> 

And here's mine, for good measure. My accounts have more followers than GF does at this time: <https://linktr.ee/gendermeowster> 

Have a great time zone! <3
Progressive Schedule Editor Access
Get editor access to StreamElements
 a. requires invite link with editor role
 b. requires streamelements account
Creating or Editing Overlays
On the toolbar at left, go to the "Streaming Tools" category
Go to "Overlays"
Under "All Overlays", look for "GF - Progressive Schedule" (there may be additional text specifying the name of the particular event)
Click "Edit"
NOTE: StreamElements displays hidden layers at 50%, rather than completely invisible. If you have multiple layers, this can make it hard to see what you're doing.
OPTIONAL: In the top right, click the "Preview" button, then click "Open in New Tab". This will allow you to see the updated overlay without the opacity issue.
For each layer, click the lock icon to unlock that layer
Near the bottom of the browser window, click "Settings" (with a wrench icon)
Click "Change Image"
Select the appropriate image for that slot in the schedule and click "Submit"
Click "Position, size, and style"
Click "Center Widget"
At the top right, click "Save". The preview of the overlay should update automatically (no need to refresh).
Repeat for all the images.

The Use of StreamElements
We are aware of the information circling social media that StreamElements may be tied to zionists. There has been some follow-up by another account.

As an anti-zionist organization, we are opposed to the (former?) leadership‚Äôs links to such parties, but unfortunately still rely on the service StreamElements supplies regarding remote control over cloud host scene management - you‚Äôll see this most in use on the scheduler update stream during the event.

We are actively looking for a service to replace this functionality that StreamElements runs. We do not provide StreamElements with any fiscal support.

Streamers
Production and/or hosting support
I want to suggest streamers consider a co-host for these events in the future because it‚Äôs so helpful. Not as a requirement, but as a ‚Äúwow that is so much easier with verbal support‚Äù. 

One thing I've learned as a spoonie (if you'd like to hear it) is the value of having someone join/support you on stream. For example, I'm having my mom join me for tarot on my stream so we can both carry the content. I've also been known to have a friend help with producing big events - like for TDOR this year, Ray produced, Kaemsi ran the slide deck, I hosted, and 10-12 others did the reading of the names. Making it a community project makes it more sustainable for me as a disabled person.
Overall Milestone Timer 
Ask each streamer to add.
‚ÄúThis overall milestones will be given away (if we reach them) on the final stream on (x) channel‚Äù
!donate command
standardize on !donate as a command for the event
Giveaways best practices
Please read the name of the winner out loud if you notice when it happens to help the donation trackers and stage managers know who won things.
Run them for 10 minutes or less. These events have enough prizes we have to move kinda fast to get through everything sometimes.

Stage Managers 
Donation Goals Posts
/announcegreen (if you have Twitch Mod status)
We are currently at (current amount)  |
Next giveaway is (overall incentive) in $(amount needed)!  |
[If we get to (amount) we unlock (milestone) for (recipient)!]
 
Example from #MiktasticMutualAid:
We are currently at 48% (approx $1,503)  |
Next giveaway is Starcrossed at $1750!  |
[If we get to 68% ($2,100) we unlock the Home Pottery Wheel for Mik!]
On adjusting the goalposts for milestones
Best practice might be sit in a VC together and work together to set goals based on vibes, the rest of these thoughts are different ideas we have discussed when trying to figure this out. I wish we had a formula. We now have a grid thing with different number jumps based on $/hr average, but that might not end up being the most ultimately, solely useful thing, so group decisions to reason it out seem best right now. ~GM
Pay attention to how big and how frequent donations are coming in and adjust from there.
As we enter a new stream, look at where we are total wise and how many milestones are expected to be hit in that stream. Based on that, choose a reasonable goal based on current trajectory (and if you know the streamer, your knowledge of their community size and generosity). When that milestone is hit, See if that streamer is expected to hit another milestone, and again choose next goal based on trajectory. 
Choosing goal based on trajectory: Find the current streamer, and go across to find the closest total donations. Use the $/hr (and pay attention to number of hours left) to add to the current total, then round to a nice number.
For example: Entering Muiramme stream the total amount donated was just over 2K. that's between the amounts of 1800 and 2400, so looking at a trajectory between 67/hr and 97/hr. We also knew that some people were donating more to cause chaos. Therefore we landed on $2200 as the next milestone.

What do I do if someone on the train gets sick, sleeps through their slot, etc?
Call the person on the schedule and confirm if they can‚Äôt make it. If someone is no-showing and you haven‚Äôt heard from them, do everything you can to confirm they can‚Äôt make it before switching the plan.
Let the current streamer know what is happening, and ask them if they have the spoons to stream longer.
Let current streamer go long and leave schedule on the person who is live even if the stated times are stale (incorrect due to extension)
If streamer must go, worst case scenario is dropping everyone off at the gender federation schedule channel. Anyone with ‚Äúeditor‚Äù permissions on that channel (which are supposed to be granted to all stage managers) should be able to execute those raids.
Find someone who can stream - if various event admins are in a call together, you may be able to organize/manage coverage. If the next streamer on the schedule is available, perhaps you go to them early and/or that person trades spots with the missing streamer (in the case of oversleeping).
Once someone is found to ‚Äúcover‚Äù that time, update the schedule image scenes on the Schedule Twitch channel (in our case, Gender Federation channel) - if you‚Äôre in a pinch you can use streamelements schedule scene to build a new one
gender federation background
4:5 individual streamer image
Post on socials about the change
Find the go live for the streamer that is covering and QRT it, explaining where we are and any appropriate amount of info about why the change is happening
Share the link to the updated info in the #social-media-booster channel and ping the booster role so folks can help with boosting the signal about the change. 
If someone with gf social media access is around, contact them to request auto posts about the absent streamer be held/paused as needed.
When you resume the regular train schedule:
update the schedule graphic to reflect being ‚Äúback on track‚Äù
Update socials with the ‚Äúback on track‚Äù info, where are we now, etc (then we can let scheduled posts resume)

Tips for Stage Managers while running event giveaways
Don‚Äôt announce the next giveaway threshold or items until the current one ends. 
Chat with other event admins/stage managers about thresholds in the group voice chat (if you can be in them). 
If the streamer doesn‚Äôt have a giveaway option set up, or their plan is failing, Gender Federation is set up to do giveaways:
Preferred: someone with parsec access uses MixItUp to run it
Alternative: folks with streamelements access (all the stage managers should have this) can use SE for it (but I hear it is a lot more complicated)
Another alternate if streamer can‚Äôt run their own giveaway: use https://wheelofnames.com/ and run the giveaway with another event admin for accountability
If a giveaway requires a physical address and/or for the winner to pay shipping, make certain that is included in the giveaway announcement for that item 
(more here - what else?)

Tips for Stage Managers fulfilling event giveaways
Make sure you look at the fulfillment info for the item
For giveaways with codes (both hourly games and milestone giveaways), they can all be found at SM ONLY - Game Codes and Milestone Codes
Make certain the Event listed for the code matches the current event, some items we have multiple that are saved for future events
For giveaways listed ‚ÄúStage manager collects info‚Äù, Go to the third tab of SM ONLY - Game Codes and Milestone Codes. Check what type of info is needed, get info from winner,  and then fill in accordingly

What to do if a game code winner tells you their code doesn‚Äôt work
Look to see if there is another copy of the same game. Double check that it doesn‚Äôt have an event assigned yet. If so, use that code instead, then assign it to the current event and mark it as fulfilled
If there is no free copy of that game, try to find another similar game. If you aren‚Äôt confident in this and KamiAnya is part of the event, you can poke them for help or have the winner contact them on Twitch whisper or discord.
If there is no similar game, or you don‚Äôt know which games are similar, pick a few games (4 is a good number) and let the winner choose between them. Make sure you only send names and not codes.

During Event Admins
Should I stage manage, donation track, and Twitch mod at the same time?
Each of those roles have specific focuses and we want to make sure those needs are all consistently and concurrently getting met. The best case scenario is enough organizing staff to separately support each role, though we recognize with time zones and the chaos of event organizing, this is not always possible.
Event Announcements Templates

Event Self-Care Tips
Preprep food ahead of time where possible.
Have things to help your brain calm down from event so sleep can happen mid event.
Plan sleep times (and try to stick to them) if that‚Äôs helpful to you.
Remember VODs exist so streams can be watched later and highlight reel will be there.
Make sure that you hydrate, have water (or hydration of choice) within easy reach.
Keep meds you might need within easy reach. 
Standing and stretch breaks
If you live with other people/people who might reach out - let them know what is going on this weekend. 
If roommates can help with taking care of you, epic.
Take the breaks when the streamer takes the break
Good way to track regular rest
Org VC is also easy way to switch out with someone so you know someone is actually watching at all times
Set alarms for basic tasks (bathroom, meds, water, food, stretch) 
If the streamer takes a break, take a break yourself! 
Hang in Org chat to get support/give support 
Org VC is also easy way to switch out with someone so you know someone is actually watching at all times 
Remind your fellow admins to take care of themselves 
Be kind to yourself! Take breaks as needed! 
If you need someone to pinch hit, ask in org VC/tag that role in relevant channel and ask for help
Key Strategy Components
Purposes of Various Prizes
During Mutual Aid Events, our organizers create and manage a robust prize offering. These not only supplement the incentives and milestones that each streamer pulls together, they also create a consistent experience for event attendees
Hourly Game Codes
Focus: Retain Viewership
We receive generous donations from multiple folks with ‚Äúhumble-bundle‚Äù-esque subscriptions to create hourly giveaways. These are offered throughout the event to encourage folks to stick around because there‚Äôs ‚Äúalways something new‚Äù about to happen. These particular games codes are not usually AAA studio games. Some may be indie games, many are the less desirable games from these bundles. On occasion when highly popular games are donated, they are slotted in ‚ÄúOverall Event Milestones.‚Äù Some recent examples of ‚Äúpopular‚Äù games include Breath of the Wild, Stardew Valley, and Untitled Goose Game.
Overall Event Milestones
Focus: Drive Donations
Overall event milestones are the more ‚Äúbig ticket items‚Äù and things that are likely to drive donations. Some examples of past rewards include: Pride lego set, ‚ÄúGender Euphoria Portraits‚Äù by Auggy/Mrs_Gendered, gift cards to queer owned businesses, and the like. 

Setting the thresholds for these items is one of the Stage Manager‚Äôs greatest challenges - we have tried many complicated ways, currently our best method is being in a voice chat together and reasoning it out so our prizes will be paced with the event and each streamer has a decent chance to hit at least one milestone during their stream, so long as we have enough prizes to offer.
Shared decision making
Event admins have found it beneficial to be in a VC while watching streams to help each other with tracking and various tasks. It makes it easier to cover short breaks, check in about milestone goal setting, etc. Even just being muted and typing in the chat can cut down on server chatter, folks feel like they need to ‚Äúcatch up on‚Äù when waking up and rejoining the event.

Team Wishlist of Future Features
Streamer Bot
Has all of our commands for the event so instead of each streamer having to configure commands etc, they just invite the bot to their channel and it is consistent everywhere. This will help a lot with emote upload cool down and last minute changes.
Feature that lets stage managers run hourly giveaways so the streamer doesn‚Äôt have to do it.
(more here, ask DJNrrd and Rosa what other feature ideas they have and other orgs what features they wish they had)
