**GenderMeowster Contributor Guidebook**



# Values

GenderMeowster’s various spaces strive to be comfy, cozy spaces for LGBTQIA+, disabled, and neurodiverse people. The spaces are anti-racist and encourage folks to learn more about decolonizing the myriad systems of internal and external oppression. 

## Gender and Sexuality

We believe that all gender identities, gender histories, and sexual orientations should be affirmed and work to support each other by normalizing pronoun usage, addressing people by the name(s) they have, and celebrating our community in our genderfulness (gender wonderfulness).

## Disability and Neurodiversity

As a disability and neurodiverse-friendly community, we avoid ableist language and have compiled resources on what to say instead. We support systems identifying as plural.

## Anti-Racism

We share resources from People of Color about racism and encourage the community to self-educate and take action to create a more just world.

# Staff Meetings

There are optional weekly all-staff gatherings on Fridays from 11a-1p Pacific in Contributor Voice Chat in the HQ discord server. This is an excellent time to bond with the team, check in about recent community moderation activities, upcoming moderation needs, server admin, etc. Things can be added to the agenda channel ahead of time or brought up during the meeting. To submit something for the agenda, respond in the weekly agenda thread in #general-chat-contributor in discord.

Rotating agenda for staff meetings:

1st Friday: discord/community (discord mods)

2nd Friday: content editors/gfx (right after the monthly content-editors-only staff meeting)

3rd Friday: Twitch Platform (Twitch mods, stream integrations)

4th & 5th Friday: General/misc (or other teams, like merch and socials, as needed)

You can schedule a 1-1 with GenderMeowster (they/them): https://calendly.com/gendermeowster

## Agenda workflow using Kanban boards

The meeting facilitator should do the following

- Copy the Agenda template, rename it with the appropriate date, and move it to the Agenda column
- Copy recent items from the [Discord Agenda channel](https://discord.com/channels/1114287837823651893/1114287840109535343) into the Tasks section of the Card
- As Tasks are discussed during the meeting
  - Identify if there are existing cards for the subject, and update the Actions section of that card
  - Create a new card, if required into the appropriate team board, assigning users and priorities as approriate
- Copy links to the card(s) above back into the Task item in the Agenda card

The meeting summariser should do the following:

- Create a brief summary of topics and actions discussed
- Post the summary to the [Discord General Chat](https://discord.com/channels/1114287837823651893/1114287839669145748) channel
- Post the summary to the Actions section of the Agenda Card

## “Meowster’s Admin Board” Trello Instructions

Board Description: *GenderMeowster's massive "to do" list for the whole organization, spanning a breadth of topics/teams. The first column, "Unedited Brain Dump from Discord," is where a bot spits stuff out to be distributed to teams later. We primarily reference this during Friday office hours and team leads manage columns related to their teams.*



**Board column (Left to Right):**
“Templates” for regular streams
“Next Month” for upcoming streams that aren’t happening this month
“This Month” for this month's scheduled streams
“This Week” for this week's scheduled streams
“Backlog (Editor To Do)” for streams with highlights/clips for content editors to deal with
“In Progress” for streams partially completed, check comments for outstanding to-do items
“Completed” for streams that are processed (don’t archive, graphics and alt text needed later)

“Next year” for streams that were indefinitely postponed
“Old Show Template Archive” for shows that aren’t scheduled again (but who knows?)

# Contributor Appreciation Day (CAD)

We have monthly Contributor Appreciation Days **on the second Thursday of the month** where Meowster and available contributors play games together on Twitch and promote the pally.gg. 

This event may also be turned into a Mutual Aid event benefitting a Clowder Contributor in need. Folks are requested to not apply more than once every 3 years to make sure other Contributors have a chance too. Internal mutual aid events (typically $500-$2,000 USD) can be applied for here: https://forms.gle/VEDzjMrUXZrD7NUR7 

# Twitch Mods

Twitch commands are curated in a Google Sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vKGeEmUIqMjwz99OSMIc8vBlayFZEJ1yWR442-3voBw/edit?usp=sharing). [GenderMeowster All Bot Commands](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vKGeEmUIqMjwz99OSMIc8vBlayFZEJ1yWR442-3voBw/edit?usp=sharing)

Twitch etiquette guidelines for both viewers and streamers by Tanya C. DePass are [here](https://cypheroftyr.medium.com/twitch-etiquette-some-things-ive-learned-b89c5ed51f5d).
Mod training video with Ray (it/they) is [here](https://youtu.be/3YY-6uUC4_8) and notes from the training are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-HNFT0m7SqUy0ooZ-XrYv8gCnVQOCjwXjOhrCyzuqwo/edit?usp=sharing).
Twitch’s Creator Camp has a section on [Moderation on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/creatorcamp/en/setting-up-your-stream/moderation-and-safety/).

## Twitch Rules

1. Respect the mods.
2. No racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, or other forms of oppression.
3. We honor diversity in this channel. 
4. Since human rights have become politicized, we also find it important to discuss politics from time to time. 
5. Don't bash other streamers or their viewers.
6. Mods and VIPs are allowed to post appropriate links. If a non-VIP wants to share a link, please whisper to a moderator or post it to discord. 
7. Please do not self-promote, ask for shout-outs/raids, or say you're live/going live.
8. While we allow brief mentions of mental health, please don't come in just to vent or trauma dump in chat. We are not mental health professionals but we will try to point you in the right direction.

## Expectations

- Pay attention to chat size/speed.
- Make sure you can hear the stream so you can respond to requests.
- VIPS get auto TEXT shout-outs from Mods (command: !so @[username]).
- Please read the **#mod-index** in discord to familiarize yourself with the staff channels.
- Actioning Aegis bans for Twitch trolls (see below for instructions).
- Update availability to moderate in the Trello tickets (see below for instructions).
- Running shout out clips on breaks (command: !yay @[username]) using [this list of streamers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k-yT6odaKBIxbPdkNPiO32j5cAdPn1HDRZj6qo5u8i8/edit?usp=sharing).
- As much as possible manage the Rewards Requests Queue as folks redeem channel points and Meowster completes the tasks on stream.
- Manage Streamloots activity feed (see below for instructions).
- Optional: engage GenderMeowster in chat and help the conversation keep moving.

## Roles (as seen in Trello)

- **Lead mod** usually focuses on security (and if we only have one mod that’s the thing to do). 
- **Secondary mod** might help keep the conversation/support more socially and is back-up security. 
- **Alternate mod:** Someone who can be there if someone else drops but is not planning to be modding otherwise
- **Fishrat Wrangler:** The mod in charge of tracking the fishrat counting using the commands in [here ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vKGeEmUIqMjwz99OSMIc8vBlayFZEJ1yWR442-3voBw/edit#gid=335156176)under “Fishrat Counting”.
- So mod view in desktop mode for lead mod is extra helpful, but a secondary mod can hang out on mobile (if needed) and help the streamer by chatting and proposing relevant conversation topics/ asking questions about what’s happening on stream etc. and in a pinch they can also use slash commands in the chat to ban folks, put the channel in emote mode in case of a hate raid, etc. this way if one mod is reporting someone to Aegis (see below), the other still has an eye on chat. 

## Backseating

- Unless otherwise stated, GM does not prefer folks to backseat. (Command: !backseating “Please ask for consent before sharing advice. Meowster will ask for help if they need it.”).

## Casual Ableism

- The !language command can be used when a person is casually ableist. As of this writing, it says: “The Clowder of Meowsters is actively working on changing up words we say so they aren’t casually ableist! For example, try wild, overwhelming, or outlandish instead of crazy, or frustrating, infuriating, or underwhelming instead of dumb. More examples can be found here: http://web.augsburg.edu/english/writinglab/Avoiding_Ableist_Language.pdf 

## Deleting Messages

- Information that could lead to the doxxing of a person (addresses, phone numbers, specific streets, names, etc).
- Misgendering messages, rude messages, messages that violate chat rules
- A quick how-to here, also includes ban and time out icons: https://www.alphr.com/delete-single-message-twitch/ 

## Time Outs

- Common reasons:
  - Rude messages
  - Misgendering (120 second time out), message in twitch chat to redirect, !pronouns 
  - Speaking in another language that isn’t English (ask them to post in English only)
  - Infodumping off-topic excessively
  - Pressuring streamer to do something (if persistent, ban)
  - frequent/excessive sadposting/venting to the point of disruptive (if intense trauma dumping, ban if unknown person or overly in depth) 
  - Some examples of previous moderator responses here : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hkOe4SFA_bmbAB_pI0hOP4L91ZmLvVR6cAv_IoAke4I/edit#heading=h.56b0d63uazl8 

Example: 
/timeout {username} [seconds], or clicking the clock symbol either directly in chat or on the user badge which appears when clicking on a username.

*Hey, @username, I see that you've used the wrong pronouns for Meowster (or whoever else has been misgendered). As per the rules of our chat, you've been timed out for misgendering them and may return to conversing after your time out is done (2 minutes). Please don't do it again.*

- Command: /timeout [username] [duration] - [reason (if needed)]
- Standard time-out button defaults to 120 seconds (2 minutes)

## Bans

- Common reasons:
  - People violating chat rules (trolls)
  - Continued misgendering
  - Bots (buy follows / spam bots are common) - you can check if an account is a know bot on this site: https://twitchinsights.net/bots 
  - Uncommon reason: hate raid
- Command: /ban [username] - reason: [reason] or use mod icons if activated
- Finish activity by reporting to Aegis (details below).
- Optional: report to Twitch, may not be auctioned but could lead to the account being removed. 

## Processing Timeouts and Bans

- Record in #twitch-bans-and-timeouts Discord channel

- Ensure you include username, message (as applicable), and reason
- How to process mass bans guide available here: https://youtu.be/__yACOC6ufs 
- One option for mass banning tools: https://github.com/victornpb/twitch-mass-ban 

## Messages to Streamer During Twitch Streams

- Post in #Twitch-mod-chat about whatever needs to be discussed privately
- Let Meowster know in the Twitch chat to look at discord if it is urgent
- If needed use the !look command to play a sound alert to ask Meowster to look at the chat (this is a mod only command).

Shield Mode and Hate Raids

If we do get a “hate raid” - where one or more channels raid in and flood chat with hurtful messages and/or spam, firstly try not to panic as we have lots of things in place to help.

**Shield Mode** - Twitch has added a feature recently called shield mode which can be activated at the press of a button, the shield symbol under the chat box does this:

![img](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe-Ff1lVsdIkmPHI-yuzSObabjuzst1uWShbvb_ByiRbEKxERwZUtzgDg_WMkNuQBA00p-9_cYI6iL63LLXbNt7XZJ_pr1CoCcEpWNSL67-JVDA7MlIXLtzaAvI0nRAbHVm3XlpOi09npQwF5rH1OLi5gwo?key=Wq0yrhDQUzfpSwHb-xRUsw)

When you click on this you should get a pop up asking if you want to activate shield mode, note the check box saying “don’t show again” if you keep this selected you may not be asked this in future and will then activate it with one click only:

![img](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdEIWOt7A4ntbrnx8F-pEqmpYmd5HlA90gPejnDl8LUZEt26jm3M2nizbVnWKBxmCsuLUT4CA3BZIb9iSsbRe5vux6wfkKlXMRRO2ykoV2RfAsTZIQFDhGFDxTsrnL_RfxZMdk-fMBP11oginKDWzhSForq?key=Wq0yrhDQUzfpSwHb-xRUsw)

To amend the settings for what is activated you can go into the shield mode “backend” via the popout in the channel actions panel:

![img](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeEZz2edjIEACvNMcObbG42yBMnrvBPKlsPUPpFfJaYk8ZfohUBcNLmgTw8hzWofJrsNLE7heHHTR0YiciL0c0Ijoqwc_lidLXGv5o2yfhCllpmvgUE4JebeFKgTWxv31BfuM8WBYDHzNiqQBgmJ74DGLXw?key=Wq0yrhDQUzfpSwHb-xRUsw)

That will open a window that allows you to customize what shield mode does when it’s activated:

![img](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc9BVWLdbrS6c2UGVPsVyUn09VgtM_Q6UMbXoKGpdNmKOmjJ-zSXMX9JXrNjm4DtvA3IDvM_jVTx4_elBVcpZbpNmU26Yc0s5DB9rCddN3g8vyDaPx3FePjozlPl0659Kz56Qr2K94Z7H0rCmtfw86t1Hg?key=Wq0yrhDQUzfpSwHb-xRUsw)

While these settings can be changed at any time it would be best to check with the lead twitch mod and/or Meowster before amending these settings, we may decide to amend these for events where it is more likely to get bad actors in chat. 

**SeryBot commands** [**https://serycodes.carrd.co/#commands**](https://serycodes.carrd.co/#commands) - these are listed in the commands sheet under the “Hate Raid” tab but the main one you will need is: **!hateraidon** this enables sub-only, clears chat, and posts a message about hate raids to the channel. Once we have things under control you can disable subs only mode using the !hateraidoff or turn it off manually in twitch. 

Meowster also has a button on their side that will enable all the things SeryBot does.

You can also enable various settings within twitch itself, this is easily done in mod view under the “Channel Actions” section: 

![img](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfaiB57L0lFBAiClnoNJLjvLW78o6gRdvXippYxkDBTQDcfcsIERdsgqCG-OvpaAAjkgQk9LopnF4TBJRSfFw12cTZ5LCEjYNtQKP_X813EVN5FFniunDG7VQ1TvKr4oWwsPTn7kCJzLJfxycO3wKy1Yj1l?key=Wq0yrhDQUzfpSwHb-xRUsw)

If you can’t access mod view (for example on mobile) these can all be done with the slash commands posted into chat:

- **/clear** - clears chat for non-mods
- **/emoteonly** - enables emote-only mode (VIPs and mods exempt)
- **/followers [duration]** - followers can only chat if they’ve followed for the amount of time specified in the [duration] this can be from 10 minutes to 3 months 
- **/slow [duration]** - limit how frequently folks can post to chat, the [duration] can be anything between 3 and 120 seconds
- **/subscribers** = enables subscribers-only mode
- **/uniquechat** = prevents users sending duplicate messages in chat

Moderating Genderful Talk Show

Extra things to consider on the talk show streams: 

- Keeping a closer eye on chat for trolls / bad actors coming in due to the topics covered.
- Watching the #ama-questions channel in discord as well as chat for questions to add.
- Each stream will have it’s own channel in the “GENDERFUL TALK SHOW” section of the discord with a google document that Meoswter collects the questions in. Here you can add questions from the Twitch chat and ama discord channel (it may be useful to keep this document open in another tab or window) here’s an example:

- If the question is relevant to the current discussion, i.e. a clarifying question, then put it below the question that Meowster is on (you can usually see their cursor on the sheet). If it's just a general question, then put it in towards the end but before the resources. 
- If you have the spoons to help with managing links or updating the resources while the episode is live, you’ll save the content editors some time and work later trying to parse resources mentioned.

Raids and Shout Outs

If we get raided (not a hate raid) you can do a number of things to welcome in the new folks:

- Post the !raiders command in chat or type in a welcome message
- Shout Out the channel that raided with both !so @[username] and /shoutout @[username] - the slash command s/o was introduced by twitch recently.
- Ask the channel that raided if they would also like a clip shout out - if they do this can be done with !yay @[username] 
- Be mindful sometimes folks will need to “raid and run” but we’re always grateful to folks for bringing their community to our stream so if you can thank the raider again. 

Streamloots Integrations

For some of the streams we have streamloots integration, the link for Meowster’s page is here: https://www.streamloots.com/gendermeowster

The main thing for the mods to do is complete the cards in the activity feed as they are done on stream (if Meowster doesn’t do them before you) 

Gifting the channel point packs (and letting folks know that exists)

Keeping track of if there are Community packs available (and letting folks know that exists)

## “Meowster’s Production Checklists” Trello Instructions

Board Description: *Production checklists, graphics for social media/promoting streams, schedules graphics, and post-production checklists.*



**Board column (Left to Right):**
“Templates” for regular streams
“Next Month” for upcoming streams that aren’t happening this month
“This Month” for this month's scheduled streams
“This Week” for this week's scheduled streams
“Backlog (To Do)” for streams with highlights/clips for content editors to deal with
“In Progress” for streams partially completed, check comments for outstanding to-do items
“Completed” for streams that are processed (don’t archive, graphics and alt text needed later)

“Next year” for streams that were indefinitely postponed
“Old Show Template Archive” for shows that aren’t scheduled again (but who knows?)

Each week a ping will go off in the twitch mod discord, this will remind the mods to go sign up for modding Twitch streams. We ask that you only sign up for the streams you are able to attend as this will allow us to arrange cover for streams where no mods have signed up. 

## Messages and Stock Responses to Audience Members

As previously mentioned, you can see some examples of previous moderator responses here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hkOe4SFA_bmbAB_pI0hOP4L91ZmLvVR6cAv_IoAke4I/edit#heading=h.56b0d63uazl8 

If you have an interaction that isn’t covered here please feel free to add it to the list as another example.

## Canceled Streams

- If a stream is canceled, Meowster will post about it in #twitch-stream-announcements and will also DM the mod signed up for that shift directly. If it is a ttrpg stream they’ll also tweet about it.

## Staff About Section![img](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd4pvB-vJlxxPJr2x80jrQU8BM0i-Awc_wOykfVSSTyMahBIy4haBHQEQCFyd9TE2BdYIwSBA2Ck9vlENnLyuIi2WG7-xlYBJiCpi54Uo_xF5WFjt6oVlugbdVARYZ8yEXo7YSe5pHAEkQGUzMhEpQ4vw?key=Wq0yrhDQUzfpSwHb-xRUsw)

- Please write a one-sentence bio with your Twitch username and pronouns if you would like to be listed as a mod on the Twitch channel “About Us” page!

# Discord Mods 

## Discord Rules

1. **No Bigotry** - No Racism, Sexism, Homophobia, Transphobia, Ableism, Furry Hate, or other forms of oppression or hate speech anywhere on the server, including your profile picture, bio, and status.

2. **Pronouns and Nicknames** - Please add your pronouns via role and/or nickname (only visible in this server) if you're comfortable doing so. For those using @PluralKit#4020 (which allows system members to post individually rather than obscured by a single nickname): please know that __headmate entries must include the account or system name__ (`pk;member <display name> servername <server display name>`). PK is for use by plural systems only.

3. **Keep it wholesome, y’all** - Don't bash other streamers or their viewers. This is *not* space for flirting or finding people to hook up with, and you should only direct message folks in the server if you’ve checked their DM role status or get *explicit* consent in a public space. You can add your direct message preferences from in #🖤role-menus.

4. **Respect the Mods** - Everyone in this chat has a right to feel safe and not crept on. If you feel like someone isn't respecting this right, please report them to the mods. Please be aware that moderators may contact you regardless of your direct message preferences.

5. **Politics or Religion** should be kept to the dedicated spaces for them. We honor the diversity of spirituality and religion on this server. Since human rights have become politicized, we also find it important to discuss occasionally.

6. **This server is part of Meowster’s living** - please ONLY advertise in #self-promotion, and don't post invites to other servers without an admin’s permission. While we believe in mutual aid and support, this is not the server to ask for financial aid. If you have something that you would like shared, please contact @Muiramme#6715 or @GenderMeowster (they/them)#5551.

7. **Content Warnings** - Certain topics can provoke strong negative responses and content that could keep users from participating (illness, stressors, traumatic events, etc) are allowed but should always be hidden using a spoiler tag and marked with a content warning (CW). Nudes and porn are not allowed under any circumstances.

 

8. **18+ only** - This wholesome server is for folks 18+ years of age. (Keep in mind rule #3).



## Expectations

- Look at pinned posts in channels to familiarize yourself with commonly referenced resources.
- Read the #server-index so you can help direct less familiar folks to appropriate spaces for their content.
- Read what folks post and watch for things against the server’s rules or the community’s values. 
- When in doubt, say something in the #discord-mod-chat - we are here to work together!
- Once modded, take a moment to sign up for the channels you typically keep an eye on (we don’t expect everyone to watch everything, and if the mod team doesn’t want to mod a channel, we should consider getting rid of it!). [Mod Channel Watching List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hijA6GhkLKwhh3NV0L7z5zljyy73hvGsz8yG3PdauMA/edit?usp=sharing) 

## New Members (Airlock System)

- The system involves a ticket tool creating a space for us to interact a little with folks before they're let into the channel completely. 👋new-friends now only contains the panel to open the ticket, no other conversation/messages should be had in that space. 
- You should get a ping whenever someone is using the panel, mostly just to let us know that something will need doing, eventually. The ticket asks for folks to answer three questions: 
- 1) Can you please confirm you've read through our 📜server-rules and that you agree to them?
- 2) Since we're an 18+ server, are you over 18?
- 3) Please let us know how you found us, whether it was GenderMeowster's streams, twitter, disboard, another server, or if a friend referred you.
- If the initial answers are vague or just not passing the “vibe check” there are a few things you can do such as:

​	1) check account age

2) twitter and disboard are more sus than direct invites (get names of direct invites)
3) get person to share a short gender related story if they claim to be trans

- If anything is making you suspicious, in their answers (or for example when we've had a report in the 🔒mod-bot-log that someone's account is freshly made) or for whatever reason, this is an opportunity to ask some clarifying questions and hopefully weed out the trolls before they get in. See more examples in stock mod responses.
- If person says they were referred by someone in the Clowder, always check with that person first (if possible) before allowing entry.
- Always check in the mod chat before allowing entry, in case someone is querying anything about the newcomer
- if all looks ok, you can approve their way into the rest of the server with =a {@user or userid} or =approve {@user or userid}
- After a new person goes through the verification process, a welcome message will appear in #general-chat. By this point, they should have received [a DM from YAGPDB with information to familiarize folks with the space](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qd4fKxj_90_9U1VCU6EC7eqxT44R4tQVnmx2_yOi9kc/edit?usp=sharing).

## Genderful Guests

- We're trying a new thing for Genderful Guests! We had some feedback that it's pretty overwhelming to be thrown into the whole server, especially when many of our Genderful Guests are new to discord. 
- In an attempt to make things simpler for them, we can bypass the standard airlock when they join the server. 
- Please manually give them the @genderful guest role, and remove @unverified. 
- They will still need to be added to the green room channel with /add by one of the folks who have access to that as well.

## Questionable Posts

- If you’re not sure or choose to delete a message in the discord, please take a screenshot so we have a record of it and post it to #mod-records. Documenting these instances also helps us navigate ban appeals.
- If possible, ask folks to edit their posts Doing this can help newcomers learn the tone of the space and remind other server users of the rules and expectations of the server.

## Muting Users

- Use this command to mute a user. You can include reasons or a time limit if wanted, but at base:
  =mute/unmute @mentionORuserID timehere some reason
- This is used when it is unclear if a kick or ban is needed.

## Processing Kicks and Bans

- Sometimes folks get kicked because they’ve been in the unverified role for too long. These folks are welcome to return to the community and try again, please include “stale application (length of time stale), welcome to reapply” as the reason for the kick. This will populate in the #mod-bot-log channel. 
- Bans are usually discussed amongst the mods in #discord-mod-chat. If you think someone is out of line, **type their username and user id** (a string of 18 numbers, you can turn this on by having “developer tools” activated in discord), and please **take screenshots** of what they said that violates the rules. If someone is clearly a bad actor and has joined the server to misbehave, banning them should give the option to delete past messages. 

- Please include a reason as much as possible when kicking or banning someone. 
- Here is an example message of [Kicking for Sad Posting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16lBNP4q3cuKa6-skB-f_VZRuCipxAyp3jDYbH7LrNzU/edit?usp=sharing).

## Casual Ableism

- The Clowder of Meowsters (this community) is actively working on changing up words we say so that they aren’t casually ableist! For example: Try wild, overwhelming, or outlandish instead of “crazy” or frustrating, infuriating, or underwhelming instead of “dumb”. 
- Mods, please keep watch for posts containing casually ableist language. If you find it, please message the person something like this: *"Hey, we noticed you used [with cw] (ableist word/phrase) in #channel, could you please replace it with [and offer one or two suitable replacements] when you get a chance?"*
- Consider passing along the Avoiding Ableist Language pdf of hyperlink found [here](http://web.augsburg.edu/english/writinglab/Avoiding_Ableist_Language.pdf). 

## SadPosting, Venting, Posts that are Sad

- **Sadposting**: unspoilered, detailed descriptions of all the reasons why and how there is sadness. There is no particular ask for thoughts or advice or anything, just "I'm sad and everything is terrible." Often visceral and notably intense.
  **Not allowed on the server.**

- **Venting**: dropping a big sad (or angry) thing into a chat and leaving, with no consideration for the conversation that was happening before and immediately leaving so that there is no conversation to be had. **
  ****Not allowed on the server.**

- **Posts that are Sad**: (aka posting about hard life things) being sad because life is hard and that is a truth for the person. Appropriate Spoilers and CWs for the sad thing are used, no in-depth dives of exactly how and why everything is hard and bad, and no sense of impending doom in every word. "I'm sad and wanted to get everyone's experience with similar things" it is better if there is some question or ask. This can be subjective and challenging, feel free to check in with the other discord mods before taking action.
  **Allowed on the server.**
- If mods find a sadpost or vent, please document the post in #mod-records and #discord-mods, (report if necessary), remove the post, and connect with the original poster.
- If mods find posts that are sad that warrant discussion, make a thread for the person and move further conversations about it there (maybe respond in the thread to demonstrate it for others.

## New Channels

- Sometimes, the community requests new channels! Let’s work together on processing these requests and documenting them well so new folks can still get familiarized to the space. Here are some steps to accomplish this:
  - When making a new channel, consider first if another channel could be modified a little or updated to accommodate the request. Server bloat is a huge reason folks get overwhelmed and stop engaging with new servers. Please consider discussing new channels with other mods/admins.
  - If you’ve discussed the new channel, please give it a name, channel description, and put it in the appropriate folder. (We do not currently have opt in spaces, but if folks request special interest related spaces, we can make a new folder with roles to opt in to help keep things tidy).
  - Please update both **#📇server-index** in the server and the [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ycGh4jHh-OOjkpm1DtE7MNrlkCFLqupEWeyOnS-OgdA/edit?usp=sharing).

## Retiring Channels

- To avoid server bloat and keep engagement up, sometimes we will have to retire underutilized channels. These changes will always be visible in the Audit Log in discord. 

## Solidarity Resources Channel

- Only admins and mods can post in #📣solidarity-resources. 
- Solidarity resources has the most reach of all of our announcement channels. So please run posts by the team via a ticket with the mod team (and Meowster) before posting and publishing there. It gets to something like 10k+ folks and has the server logo, which is very similar to Meowster’s profile picture, so it represents the brand pretty strongly.
- When posting content, please put a title at the top denoting the type of anti-oppression the content supports. 
  - Some common examples: Disability, Neurodiversity, Race, Gender, or Sexuality
  - Please put two asterisks on either side of the title so the title is bold. Here is an example:
    **Disability and Neurodiversity**

https://www.autistichoya.com/p/ableist-words-and-terms-to-avoid.html 

## Pinning Posts

- Please feel empowered to pin posts that are useful resources for future folks!
- if ever we have a channel that hits the pins limit (it has happened before in streamers only and maybe gender and sexuality), let's make a google doc in the GenderMeowster google account and copy/paste the older pinned resources, then pin that document. Then let it refill until we hit 50 again, then add to google doc and keep going.

## Mentions of Self-Harm (rare)

In the uncommon event a server member threatens self-harm:

- Document in mod-records before deleting. 
- Ping the discord mods in the dedicated chat to let them know what is happening. 
- Discuss with the mods if muting or banning is indicated.
- Not recommended: you may try to follow up with the person, but know that it is not your duty to save someone. Do not call the cops on the person - police often exacerbate these types of issues, especially in BIPOC, trans/gender diverse, and neurodivergent communities. Following up typically leads to mods feeling burnt out and accountable if something terrible happens - and it may reinforce unhealthy tendencies in the original poster. Referrals to more appropriate support resources are listed below.

## Common and Uncommon Issues

- **Self Promo** - Folks will often post self-promotion topics in the wrong spaces. Screenshot it, send it to the individual requesting they re-post it in the appropriate channel (#self-promo) and delete the message. Please note that other discord servers, GoFundMe, OnlyFans, and other financial requests are not allowed per rule 5 of the server and per the channel description for #self-promo.

Trello Instructions (for Content Editors)

From left to right you have panels for “Templates” for regular streams, “Schedule” Upcoming streams that aren’t happening this month, “This Month” this month's scheduled streams , “This Week” this week's scheduled streams, “Backlog” streams with elements for CE to deal with, “In Progress” streams with elements for GM to deal with, “Completed” all done! 

For the podcast and meme streams there is a content editors checklist section in the card, this should assist you in remembering the tasks that needs to be done on these. 

Check the backlog for tasks, if there are cards in this section complete the tasks and move the card to the “In Progress” tab so Meowster knows it’s been worked on.

# Aegis

Aegis is a community run, pre-emptive ban reporting service, with collaboration space for Streamers, Discord server owners, and their associated administration/moderation teams.

How it works:

When we ban folks from Meowster’s discord server or twitch channel we record the reasons in Meowster’s discord but we also report these to Aegis. 

Twitch bans go to #twitch-ban-inputs using the following convention: 

[username] - [reason] - [reporting channel] 

For example: russogox - "Buy followers" spam - GenderMeowster

![img](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfHhM165i--GtD8r79N0kMacXTUd8ooX6rdEItBF2KzFoaQaCHxOrlgCYYaU20E1LI_7QQ8OgLKvXyoFg6ubBcx6wrnYkz7a3s36dE-ZslQyK58bsrs8c35niIO17Lc3Nu-JbJDLELYe74-PeOZI7Isqdg?key=Wq0yrhDQUzfpSwHb-xRUsw)

![img](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf1Li0Y-RzAM5RCHT4PMiXZPVDXN6UIEJxHRmEfAZtR6SJT9VuHb2iuSKKQZG2O-9I51pTdIjAa92JGlXyJc6H1Q0PH8Yz3tgMlkIK1q8UbgkIPq7z_Bh2CYX1DNxevx6zDEwolCyxJBKHYoXFXovVjlcgo?key=Wq0yrhDQUzfpSwHb-xRUsw)

Discord bans go to #discord-ban-inputs using the following convention:

[user ID number] - [reason] - [reporting channel] 

For example: 195790894987739136 - Part of troll raid - GenderMeowster

![img](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfIUa63Ek87CPIs186biCFDhigWxUOUvpKN2JU_cVvaUNr2KyKceLVsKf5eXZVCbEGrIBmhb0ZAOSe-0yXV8-Onu9-5nzU1Y-VvGBDn8wmXP2Ig0CcgwLKqY8xKprjXg5uXbikSnZqtD3pJLLmnaAf8tiBQ?key=Wq0yrhDQUzfpSwHb-xRUsw)

![img](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcSVYYfJe-Jkkjbt7sliuyeBOoquW4n7EQlzamKFEK_ic-D549259anJOr6zen5k1Q1h29JFRvMqVXCsgDwwuOhOKbhK93pnyrphzh9r_8tEI8N_2bwskpYw_RiCdziF7Fg1bTL485z8aEpSaje_Qriabwx?key=Wq0yrhDQUzfpSwHb-xRUsw)

The other folks in the server also do this and these ban reports get “pushed” into the #twitch-bans-and-reasons & #discord-bans-and-reasons channels. 

As these come in the Meowster mod action these bans as appropriate, the reasons provided should give us an idea of why the user was banned so we know if they have infringed on the rules of Meowster’s discord server / twitch channel. 

If we are unsure we can go into the Aegis discord and look over any additional information (or request it if it’s not been posted already) and use that to make a decision on if we should action the ban. Most of the reports are quite straight forward as they’re trolls, bots etc. so these are banned. 

# Other Staff Adjacent Folks

## Community Ambassador

Community Ambassadors (CAs) are members of the community that have been around for a while and help engage directly with participants in the community. Moderators often also behave in a capacity similar to community ambassadors by building engagement, but some CAs are just regulars or VIPs who do not want the added responsibility of moderation. CAs are often engaged in both the Twitch and Discord spaces and regularly post in chats and channels. CAs are also empowered to plan special events for the community.
