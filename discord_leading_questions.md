**Content warning for manipulation tactics if someone seems suspect. If you are uncomfortable being deceptive to weed out trolls, message LeatherJacketBear:****

These are questions you can generally ask to weed out trolls if someone is giving vague or noncommittal answers for entry to the server. An important note to mention when it comes to people who end up passing the sniff test in the end is to be open and apologetic about the process we put them through, explaining about bad actors using similar noncommittal language to try and deceive us in the past.

**Always reword these questions whenever possible to not make it seem like we’re going from a script.****

**Unfortunately, bad actors do learn over time, if they bother to try. This makes it seem like more of an organic process of getting wise to the act rather than knowing beforehand, and could send them into a spiral that ends up with us left alone by them due to the fear it creates. (Note to self, explain this process in the Mod chat at some point.)

The Method:

****
**To be used if onboarding answers are very vague and they specifically mention  "To find other trans people" and have used Disboard as a discovery method. Very specifically look at the account age as well, and use your discretion whether to add that as grounds for suspicion.

“Oh, making other trans friends is valid as heck! What are your pronouns? Tell me a little bit about yourself!!”

This one step should sift most low effort chuds out of the process right away. Most shy away from even entertaining the idea of pronouns or will give themselves away immediately with their pronoun picks. As an example, I run a tabletop discord and we used to get trolls daily. After making it require pronoun roles to post messages we got literally zero trolls.

The other prong of this war-fork is asking for personal details, even such wishy washy ones, mean they have to come up with lies on the fly, and those tend to be very easy to see through.


**General Tips:**

Sometimes, someone might slip through the verification process and be inactive just to spy on the people they hate. If someone comes in, passes verification, then says nothing. Keep an eye on profile pictures and statuses for this.

Keep watch for people using concern trolling. It’s fairly easy to spot. “I'm just worried about you!” when someone objects to advice that usually follows a very "I know what's best for you random stranger” style vibe.**
