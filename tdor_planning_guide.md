# TDOR group event specific reminders

- What accommodations can we keep in mind for each other?
- Reminder to mute your mic when you aren’t speaking. Zoom hosts may assist you with that if you forget.
- If seeing yourself talking in Zoom is distracting, there is a setting to turn off the “self-view”
- Reminder to update name and pronouns in zoom, we will do a gallery scene with all of us at the beginning
- We will take a break in the middle of stream. **Please mute your mic on break.**
- You can watch Twitch chat if you want to interact with the live audience more directly, please keep conversation limited to chatting in the Twitch chat, not out loud on stream. https://www.twitch.tv/popout/GenderMeowster/chat?popout= 

# Overview of the structure of the event

- Starting soon (guest mute mic)
- Producer will post tweets and discord promos
- Just chatting/greet audience (Host)
- Switch to group scene
- Content warnings/land acknowledgement (you will be visible at this point, **unmute your mic here**)
- Opening statements, Mutual Aid info 
- Primary TDOR Content with the reading of the names by month (automatic timers in chat regularly by bot posts with content warning, info about tdor, and info about the mutual aid associated with this event). 
- “What Is Remembered, Lives” call and response from each reader at the end of your month, the slide and reading aide both will prompt you.
- Note: The scene will only show the active reader - if hosts or other readers look distracted, they may be moderating the chat or processing personal feelings about the event. The audience cannot see the rest of us once we have left the gallery view greeting period.
- Take personal bio breaks as needed - we likely won’t stop the flow of the event if we can help it.
- After October of this year, we will go back to gallery view once more to have closing thoughts and say goodbye to everyone.
- Community Updates (Just Chatting, Host only scene)
- share weekly schedule and raid info, send the raid
- End the recording in Zoom
- Host: facilitates Stars and Wishes (feedback loop from guests, there is a google form).

- **PRODUCER: START THE ZOOM RECORDING**
- Guests: Post on social media about the stream (optional) and/or retweet GM post

# Self care reminders

- Remember your breath - your body is not actively receiving trauma in this moment, it is ok to breath, take your time, process your feelings as you go
- Drink water
- Take breaks as needed
- You don’t have to stay for the whole thing (doorbell sound should be off)
- If you work with a higher power of some sort, prayer or meditation may help regulate your emotions
- Creating sacred space that you can also take down may help with letting go of the event afterwards. Meowster likes to light a candle at the starts and blow it out at the end as a small ritual to do this.

- Group grounding exercise before we go live: square breathing

TDOR Opening Statement
*Content Warnings for this stream include descriptions and mentions of death, murder, suicide, neglect, grief, and anger. This is an 18+ stream.*

**Stream Intro Host says:**

Meowdy folks! Welcome to our Trans Day of Remembrance stream and grief ritual. This is a show we do annually, at the end of Trans Awareness Week, to remember and hold space for the trans people we’ve lost over the past year. We will read the names of those we lost, and how they died, and send them onwards in peace.


**Self care**

This stream gets intense, so please do remember to take care of yourself first. Hydrate, take meds, step away for a break. Please speak to the mods if you have any issues, they’re here to help. Given the content, please be aware that this is an 18+ stream.


**Targeted Violence**

Trans people are far more likely to be targeted, or killed by intimate partner violence, and that likelihood grows exponentially for non-white trans people, and trans folk with disabilities, and other marginalizations.

We live knowing that people want to exterminate us, will go to any lengths to stop us from living freely and joyfully, and that any of those people might try to do so at any time, when passing legislation is too slow. Today we remember that, as we name and hold space for our lost.

This is a live-streamed recording that will be later published on the GenderMeowster YouTube channel.

# 

## Direct Mutual Aid Statement

Let’s start at the beginning, what is mutual aid? What does it mean?

- Mutual aid is a community-led effort to provide people within that community with items, funds, or other assistance they need, often but not always in an urgent situation. For example, **in this case we’re raising funds for** ezra, who needs top surgery revisions and help paying for their cat’s medical needs.
- Mutual aid is a form of direct, grassroots solidarity and support that is based on the principle of collective action and mutual assistance within communities.

How is it different from charity and other forms of giving?

- **Money always does the most good when it is given directly to people in need.** You can search locally for GoFundMes for trans and disabled people. You can also subscribe to Patreons of creators in need. That one’s a nice option because it’s automatically recurring, and as you have more funds available you can always increase your donation amount over time.
- While charity is top-down one-way giving, mutual aid is community-driven, based on reciprocity, and seeks to build sustainable and supportive communities rather than just providing short-term relief.
- Mutual aid can be a more empowering and sustainable approach than charity. Rather than relying on external organisations to provide assistance, mutual aid networks help build collective solutions to economic challenges.

# Land Acknowledgement: 

We would like to **acknowledge the indigenous peoples** and unceded lands that the producers, hosts, and readers live and have dwelt upon. 



Hexagonelle - Today we honour the peoples of: 
Ezra - Comanche

Dominick - Coahuiltecan and Jumanos

TransCapybara - Coast Salish

Kaemsi - amaNdebele, amaZulu, and Khoi-San

Miranda - Mohawk, Algonquin, and Anishinabewaki

Char - Algonquin, Anishinabewaki, and Haudenosaunee

TolstoiL12j - Coast Salish

Meowster - Coast Salish

Nora - Ohlone

Aranock - Treaty 6, Métis

Ray - I recognise that I come from a land with an extensive history of colonisation and I have benefited from the appropriation of peoples and cultures.



Hexagonelle - We honor the elders, the human, plant, and animal ancestors of these lands, and celebrate the living descendants of these peoples. May all beings tend these lands for the goodness of the next seven generations and beyond.

## Closing Thoughts Group grounding exercise after TDOR names are completed: square breathing

## Self care reminders

- Remember your breath - your body is not actively receiving trauma in this moment, it is ok to breath, take your time, process your feelings as you go
- Drink water
- Take breaks as needed
- You don’t have to stay for the whole thing (doorbell sound should be off)
- If you work with a higher power of some sort, prayer or meditation may help regulate your emotions
- Creating sacred space that you can also take down may help with letting go of the event afterwards. Meowster likes to light a candle at the starts and blow it out at the end as a small ritual to do this.

# Share cute photos invite:

Share a picture in discord of your pets, your plushies, with or without you in them. Today is TDOR and a lot of us are grieving and need some emotional support. I figured we could all benefit from some cute pictures today!

If you aren’t part of the server yet, you’ll have to wait for the event cooldown before the mods can let you in. If you’re already in the server, please share away! :D

## **5 things you can do to support trans people**

1. Be an upstander, not a bystander - if you see or hear someone being or saying negative and aggressive things about trans people, intervene. Speak up, take action, don’t wait for someone else to do it.
2. Contact your representatives - investigate what is happening legislation wise where you live and say something about it. Call, email, or send physical mail to your representatives about it. 
3. Volunteer - Get in touch with local and national advocacy groups and volunteer your time.
4. Donate - Contribute to direct mutual aid to trans folks. One way to find folks in need is to search #TransCrowdFund on social media and donate directly to the person’s PayPal, CashApp, Venmo, Pally.gg, etc.
5. Connect - spend some time this week reaching out to your trans friends, co-workers, or family members. Ask them what they need. Listen. Offer support. Maybe buy us dinner.

# **Post Production Show Notes**** ****Youtube Description:**

On the International Transgender Day of Remembrance, we commemorate and honor the lives of our transgender and gender non-confirming community who were murdered due to transphobia and transmisia. Light a candle and join us as we read each name recorded from Oct. 2022 to Sept. 2023. GenderMeowster, Meowster's Clowder discord server, and Gender Federation hosted this TDOR 2023.

✔ WHAT’S TDOR? ✔

▶ "Transgender Day of Remembrance seeks to highlight the losses we face due to anti-transgender bigotry and violence. I am no stranger to the need to fight for our rights, and the right to simply exist is first and foremost. With so many seeking to erase transgender people - sometimes in the most brutal ways possible - it is vitally important that those we lose are remembered and that we continue to fight for justice."

   \- Transgender Day of Remembrance founder Gwendolyn Ann Smith

▶ More info about TDOR can be found here: https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/ 

✔ MUTUAL AID ✔
