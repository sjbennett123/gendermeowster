## Values

- GenderMeowster’s various spaces strive to be comfy, cozy spaces for LGBTQIA+, disabled, and neurodiverse people. The spaces are anti-racist and encourage folks to learn more about decolonizing the myriad systems of internal and external oppression. 

## Gender and Sexuality

- We believe that all gender identities, gender histories, and sexual orientations should be affirmed and work to support each other by normalizing pronoun usage, addressing people by the name(s) they have, and celebrating our community in our genderfulness (gender wonderfulness).

## Disability and Neurodiversity

- As a disability and neurodiverse-friendly community, we avoid ableist language and have compiled resources on what to say instead. We support systems identifying as plural.

## Anti-Racism

- We share resources from People of Color about racism and encourage the community to self-educate and take action to create a more just world.
