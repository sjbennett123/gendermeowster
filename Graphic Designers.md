Welcome to the Graphic Designers Team!

# Basic process documentation

Hi there! I'm your Team Lead, Lexington (he/him), AKA Lex Asterion in the Discord, otherwise known as Transgriffin. I cordially welcome you to the Graphic Designers Team. This document aims to answer any basic questions about the various graphics creation processes to facilitate your onboarding.

# What graphics do we create?

There are different categories of graphics that the team members create. Each category gets its own Drive folder that gets shared with the people in charge. The main categories are namely:

- **Community Graphics:** These are used for the Discord server or for Twitch, and include emoji, stickers and animations. In general, they are digital graphics in web resolution (typically 72-100 DPI) that cannot be used for merch. The designs themselves may be carried over to merch, but in that case, adequate resolution versions for both purposes must exist. File sizes are limited per purpose.

- **General Branding Assets:** The source folder for the most basic assets used for various GenderMeowster promo and stream overlay material. Those can be: Borders, boxes, backgrounds, logos and show-exclusive items such as the TDOR candles. This category has some overlap with the Merch and Community Graphics categories.

- **Merch:** Any non-animated PNG graphics may be added to the merch repository for printing on physical items such as hats, shirts or stickers. The image, however, must be sufficient in size and resolution (typically 300 DPI and 1000x1000px or above), and copyright-safe. Test uploads to Redbubble can further help determine whether a design is fit for the purpose or not.

- **Youtube Thumbnails:** They are the glamorous faces of our Youtube videos. Genderful thumbnails get a separate place inside Genderful Episode Promo.

- **Genderful Episode Promo:** Each of our guests gets a 3-part set of promotional graphics, both for their own uses and the different GenderMeowster web presences. On our side, the graphics are created one each for Instagram/Anchor, Youtube and Discord. Template files with fixed layouts are available. This category has overlap with Social Promo.

- **Social Promo:** For every show that GenderMeowster produces, there is an Instagram and a Discord graphic. Additionally, every show week gets its own graphical schedule. These images get posted on social media and Discord. This category receives sub-folders for different social media projects, such as the Contributor Spotlights.

More folders and categories may be added at a later point in time.

# What Software do I need?

If you’re going to be working with promotional material, you’ll need to be able to open and edit .PSD files, as our templates are saved in this format. Programs that support those files out of the box include:

-  Adobe Photoshop
- Clip Studio Paint
- Affinity Photo
- CorelDRAW
- Paint Shop Pro
- GIMP (free)
- Photopea Online Editor (free)
- XnView (free).

The editing capacities may vary, but ultimately the choice is yours.

Otherwise, all that you will need is a graphics editing program of any kind that supports transparent PNG files.

Animations can be made in various programs, including but not limited to GIMP, Photoshop and Clip Studio Paint.

In the best case scenario, you simply use the software that you’re already using for your personal projects or work. Before you spend money on software for GenderMeowster purposes, check in with the Team Lead and take a look at open source and freeware programs available.

# Where do I get my templates and sizes?

When you sign up for the Graphic Designers Team, you get your own access to the Team’s Drive folder. Not all graphics categories possess templates, but those that do are:

- Genderful Episode Promo
- Social Promo

You can find the templates inside the respective folders under “PSD Templates”.

Templates make your life easy! Simply copy one of the layer folders, rename it for your purpose and fill in the data needed. You will find examples inside the existing layer folders.

Since different purposes and platforms possess different file size limitations and size requirements, we maintain an overview document with all the different information.

Find this document here:

[Dimensions for Graphics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1im4oV3T3zhel16oaoO3_Zg40cttZE89I24hh-VQDsK8/edit?usp=share_link)

Additionally, there is a repository of pride flag gradients that Lexington curated. The repository is in the Photoshop .grd format. This may or may not only be useful for Photoshop users.

Add Link to Gradients file here

# How do I find out my tasks?

GenderMeowster maintains a Trello board with all sorts of tasks for the whole Contributor Team. They can either give you access to the Trello board or have the Team Leads delegate those tasks to their team members (you). Additionally, the #graphic-designers-chat Discord channel gets used for graphics requests.

For recurring graphics needs such as Genderful or Social Promos, there are Google Calendars available that can be shared to you if needed.

# What do I do when I’m done?

Once you’ve finished creating a graphic, you can post it in the #graphic-designers-chat Discord channel for approval.

After approval, upload your graphic into the corresponding Drive folder within this repository. **Do not make changes to access permissions.**

For some graphics, we maintain a tracking file for easy overview of all existing graphics within their categories. This applies to the following categories:

- Merch
- Community Graphics
- General Branding Assets

Find this tracking file here:

[General Graphics Tracking.xlsx](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JOj3Em38sdFhNgge6XELT0oA13oUjbcP/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107725470552331506616&rtpof=true&sd=true)

If your new graphic fits within any of those categories, copy its Drive share link and fill out the table contents for your graphic on the category-respective sheet (look at the bottom of the document window). If it fits within multiple categories, copy-paste the information into the respective sheet inside the tracking file and adjust the Drive link to the respective version of your graphic that possesses the correct dimensions for its purpose.

And now… Celebrate!

# But I have more questions!!!

There will be process documentations within the category folders of those types of graphics that have a template and a set workflow.

Use the #graphic-designers-chat channel in Discord and ping me, @Lex Asterion (he/him) for further assistance or DM me directly. I am here to support your work!

Graphics Design Procedure

For Genderful and Social Promo Materials

Latest edit: March 29, 2023 by Lexington

This document contains written instructions for the creation of Genderful and Social Promo materials, as well as Drive links to PSD template files.

For a basic video tutorial, follow this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIWK9nUgV74

**Please refer to the written instructions in any case, as video tutorials can't be easily updated and the processes may be subject to change. The video can still help you get a general idea of the process and help as a visual guidance.**

**This Video is up-to-date as of March, 29th 2023. Outdated as of April 14th, 2023 but still useable.**

## General Branding Guidelines:

- For basic information on the creation of graphics and what software to use, please refer to the following document: [Graphic Designers Onboarding Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I9ewx1oWcaz6gx24TH-AUJpPxKAP9x6oj-cTm6oB-5k/edit?usp=sharing)
- The background is the non-binary flag as a gradient going through the image at a 45° angle.
- Pride flags for Genderful guests also follow the 45° angle of gradient. If you can't find a pride flag inside the template's repository, try re-creating it by pasting a google image into the clipping mask and make sure it follows the angle and is blurred to look like a gradient. The non-binary pride flag must run in a mirrored direction to the one of the background image.
- Only one pride flag may be used for a guest at a time. If they suggest multiple flags, pick the first suggestion or the guest’s favorite, if such a flag has been designated.
- The font of choice is Roboto Black, downloadable from Google for free.
- All rounded corners follow a 43px corner size setting.
- The color palette for all elements is given inside of the templates. Generally, we use purples, blacks, whites and yellows.
- There is a cheering Neferkitty logo on the YouTube and Instagram graphics for Genderful guests.
- The schedule has a rounded rectangle, “band-aid” style look for the text boxes, with side-alternating rounded square boxes containing images relevant to the content of the announced streams. The text boxes alternate in colors for easy visual differentiation between stream days. Shows running on The TransVerse get a trans flag text box background.
- Layout elements and line spaces for text are all pre-configured in the templates. One may need to adjust font sizes to accommodate longer texts or titles. The text field in the Discord slides can be expanded downwards for this purpose, without adjusting font size.
- Font sizes for titles ought to be as large as possible without cutting into other elements, and then one or two sizes smaller for them to not appear crammed.
- All template files contain different layer folders for different purposes. The Instagram and the Discord templates have their own category folders for recurring events, singles, and Genderful - within those folders you will find an array of already made graphics that you can duplicate and then edit for new graphical purposes.
- Rainbow clipping masks above white bases possess an opacity setting of 63%

**New information as of April 14th, 2023: ALL Instagram images, including the schedule, will from now on be made in 4:5 format. The training video does not reflect that.**

1. Check the Google calendar and/or the Trello to find out the schedule of the up-coming week. Any regularly happening streams will most likely happen at the same show times as always (Genderful being the exception!), so you can refer to the existing graphics on the Trello for that information.
2. Edit the given text field with the dates at the top of the schedule to fit for the coming week. Use abbreviated month names.
3. You will see that each day of the streaming week has its own folder. Each folder contains a collection of possible streams for that weekday. Each of these has a folder of its own which contains the layers of the corresponding day’s text box, text field, images, and clipping masks.
4. The first day to be edited is Monday. If there is no Genderful guest, see if you can use the Co-Working stream template, or copy that to make your own announcement. If there is no stream at all, there’s a picture of Neferkitty sleeping, which can be used. Make the time info and the twitch info invisible by disabling layer effects and turning the text the color of the background, in case you need these text fields later. Or simply make sure you’re editing a copy of a given template to prevent losing useful pre-arranged text fields permanently when you delete the text.
5. **If there is a Genderful guest**, refer to the AMA document to find out the episode’s topic, guest name and showtimes. Refer to the Talk Show Guest Application for the guest’s pride flag and download their image from there. The time of the episode can be found out either via Google Calendar (start time +30min tech= live time that goes into the gfx), the Talk Show Guest Application, the Trello, or by asking inside the episode’s respective Discord channel.
6. Fill out the episode number, topic, show times and guest name (and pronouns, but space may be limited!). Add the guest’s picture as a clipping mask to the “cookie cutter” and enable visibility on the correct pride flag. If the guest’s preferred pride flag is not inside of the folder, create a new clipping mask to the pride flag base and make your own (the general guidelines above have more info).
7. If the Genderful guest has submitted a translucent image, the background of the image box must be solid purple, HEX code #543171.
8. The consecutive stream days will likely feature streams we’ve had before. Look inside the weekday folders and see if you can find the pre-made designs for those and simply enable their layer visibility. If the show times have changed or there’s extra guests, edit that design according to the new information.
9. If there is a brand new stream, copy one of the existing design folders inside of the same weekday, rename it to fit the new stream, and use that as a template for all the new information and images.
10. Always feel free to adjust the text size a little if it gets too crammed.
11. Use a clipping mask to the given bases to fit in new graphics. You just have to copy-paste the new image on top of the layer containing the solid colored rounded square and turn the new graphic layer into a clipping mask directly above the square layer. The picture will be “cut” into the shape of the white square. You can move the picture layer around freely now and resize it to fit into the margins of the mask.
12. Do not edit the square itself unless you need to recolor it for a transparent graphic. Usually a translucent rainbow clipping mask above a solid white square does the trick. Generally, you can always use a second clipping mask underneath the image to give it a colored background. Always do that above the white square layer.
13. Whatever you do, do not edit the basic layout boxes directly, unless you need to recolor a box because of an important event (like TDOV or TDOR), or a new stream on The TransVerse. Those are the basic layout elements and help keep things where they belong, so please restrict the editing to color and don’t change the dimensions of the elements.
14. Export as PNG in full quality and upload to #graphic-designers-chat in Discord, as well as to Trello. If there is no card yet, copy the schedule template **without** comments and attachments (checklists are still needed) to its respective spot and upload the image into it as the card cover.
15. GenderMeowster may have some corrections to the schedule at this point. Remember to upload the latest version to Trello and Discord if you make any further edits.

For Instagram Schedule Reels:

File: [2023 Instagram Template.psd](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1otU8hZOw4AvNQgMCtXWfDlMrEL0Sa3hJ/view?usp=sharing) **(FILE UP TO DATE MARCH 29 2023)**

1. Basically the same steps as above.
2. Edit each card inside its folder and export them individually.
3. Genderful cards get a pride flag of the guest’s choice (or none, then just the empty cookie cutter) behind the photo.
4. The photo goes above “photo cookie cutter” as a clipping mask.
5. Please do not alter the positioning of elements or edit the cookie cutters.

For Genderful YouTube Thumbnails:

File: [2023 Youtube Template.psd](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p1v9EchzB6TYhIKs3lgNKe9SHinNCWuI/view?usp=sharing)**(FILE UP TO DATE MARCH 29 2023)**

1. Just Edit the text fields as needed. The Episode Title field might need the font resized for longer titles.
2. Put the guest’s photo as a clipping mask above the photo cookie cutter.
3. Choose a pride flag clipping mask above the pride flag cookie cutter corresponding to the guest’s wishes or create a new one using an image or gradient if needed. If you use an image or a gradient with sharp edges between colors, use the gaussian blur on 11 pixels.
4. Please do not alter the positioning of elements or edit the cookie cutters.
5. Export
