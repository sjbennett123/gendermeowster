**~Key~**

**Category**

\#channels *Description of channel*

*Please note that most channels in a category are organized either in the order you'd use them (especially in welcome, and putting the general chats first) or alphabetically (most of the other spaces).*

# __**Welcome and Info**__

\#👋new-friends *When you join the server your name lands here, mostly a bot log. Please accept #server-rules before being admitted to #general-chat under the “general” category.*

\#📜server-rules *Code of Conduct type agreements so our community stays safe, fun, and ready for more nerdery! Must accept before accessing the rest of the server.*

\#🖤role-menus *Pick your pronoun(s) and any identities if you so desire! This is a queer-positive and gender-affirming space. React to gain access to juicy opt-in channels or claim a role that lets us tag you when we’re playing a certain game on stream or just in the server so you can join us! Note: if your pronouns or identity isn’t listed, let a mod know and we will add it for you.*

\#👋🏾introduce-yourself *Please feel free to introduce yourself and include any links to social media, twitch, youtube, etc where we might find you! Please only create one post here and edit it if you have new things to add. We encourage you to #introduce-yourself in a style similar to Meowster’s pinned post. Please respond to others’ intros by posting in #💬general-chat.*

\#📇server-index *Space describing public and opt-in spaces in this server, so you don’t have to click on each channel description to learn what things are! Does not include moderation index (that is separate).*
