# Discord Mod Training 2021 

Discord mod roundup agenda:

- Read the mod handbook
- unverified follow-ups
- divvying up channels+: Sign up [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hijA6GhkLKwhh3NV0L7z5zljyy73hvGsz8yG3PdauMA/edit?usp=sharing). 
- working together to address folks instead of "I noticed that and didn't know what to do and didn't say anything" (examples?)
- processing discord bans from Aegis
- Sending bans to Aegis (Meowster can do this if Muir doesn’t feel ready to explain)
- Creating stock responses to recurring things, please add to the doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hkOe4SFA_bmbAB_pI0hOP4L91ZmLvVR6cAv_IoAke4I/edit?usp=sharing).
- intentionally keeping chat going/starting conversations instead of just moderating/reading and leaving. Generally being more engaged, especially with new folks. 
- Grey areas - how intensely do we enforce rules? (pronouns, casual ableism, sadposting/venting, vs. hate speech and mature content)
- Three strikes (new): Mod records include username and what the “strike” is for, three strikes until action, action might be ban for a year and refer to lgbtq+ support server (especially if underaged, before the 18+ goes into effect).
- Upcoming changes regarding age, we need help vetting redirect servers:
  - Showing up in VCs (good)
  - Posting on a regular basis (good) 
  - Rules - how are pronouns enforced? Edge posting? Safety protocols, especially protecting personal information?
  - Spaces for youth? Spaces to discuss gender identity? (good if yes)
  - Venting channel? (Possible mark against the server, these often get out of control, yellow flag).
- 18+ updates coming soon
- Streamers Only only vs Self-Promo
  - For now, relocate and give heads up (recent) or delete and DM (aged)
  - If someone does promo in streamers 3x, they lose the streamers role so they can’t keep making that mistake
  - May implement bots in the future
- No discord links unless admins approve (usually only in “meowster affiliates” channel)
- No Fundraising posts, alternatives: Meowster can QRT your thingy, Meowster may choose to do a fundraising stream for you
- For newcomers who say they were referred by someone in the server, always confirm with the person if possible before allowing entry
- Always check in the Discord mod chat before allowing someone in, in case a mod has brought up a potential issue.

**Samples of things that need addressing:** 

Posting promo links in the wrong channel: delete the message, potentially repost it in the #self-promo channel and tag the person. If not that, let them know why via DM. Let them know we’re not upset with them, potentially use tone tags like /genuine and /friendly to help those with anxiety know what’s up. 

Similarly, **posting discord links** anywhere on the server without express permission--it’s against our rules. 

**Spoilers for sensitive subjects**, food mentions outside of the food channel. Lack of use of CW: subject with spoilers also needs addressing as much as possible. When giving feedback, do your best to be gentle and help try and get folks to understand why we want them to do this: Folks may have many different triggers in the server, we’d like anything that’s somewhat sensitive to be opt-in because you can’t opt out of reading things that make you upset other than stopping engaging/leaving the server. 

**If you see something that you don’t have spoons to deal with** at the moment, or you’re not sure if it requires addressing, please post about it in the discord mod chat and we can get more brains on it!

Some things are obvious in enforcement: hate speech and mature content are clear breaking of our rules and should likely result in a ban. **Things that feel on the edge are much trickier** -- especially if the person is someone who has been otherwise engaging in what seems like good faith. Those things still need to be addressed. If you feel like something is making you uncomfortable but you’re not quite sure how to address it, it’s potentially making other community members just as uncomfortable and it absolutely needs to be addressed, somehow. You are *always* encouraged to bring such things up to the rest of the mod team--that’s part of why we are a team!

**Pronouns usage and casual ableism are things addressed in our rules.** We encourage everyone to grab pronoun roles when they enter the server but there are some important reasons they may not want to share their pronouns as well. Our “no pronouns applicable” or “any pronouns” roles are intended to fill that space, but as it is a safety-related situation we will not strongly enforce pronouns. 

**Casual ableism** is something we’re encouraging people to be aware of--it’s endemic to a lot of languages and a hard habit to break. If you see anyone using cas ableism particularly during a conversation you’re having, we’d encourage you to address it there in the chat. Responding publicly (and in a kind/gentle manner) can help educate more of our community on what/why we’re asking what we’re asking. Please reinforce that we’re not mad, upset, or going to ban them for what they’ve said. A lot of folks have high anxiety about getting feedback from the moderation team, so directing folks to the places they can learn more is not enough
