hey [name] - I wanted to talk to you about the sadposting in #channel. Up to a certain point, I and the other mods really do our best to be supportive and talk things through with people who are having a difficult time. With that in mind, we’ve reached a point where we need to prioritize the health of the community and have decided to kick you from the community for 1 year. 

You’re welcome to rejoin the community when you’re in a better place and feel like you’ll be able to follow our guidelines. We really do hope things improve for you, and that you’ll be able to find support through therapy or affinity groups that meet your needs.
