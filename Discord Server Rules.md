# Discord Server Rules

1. **No Bigotry** - No Racism, anti-Semitism, Sexism, 2SLGBTQIA+ hate, Ableism, Furry Hate, or other forms of oppression or hate speech anywhere on the server, including your profile picture, bio, and status.
2. **Pronouns and Nicknames** - Please add your pronouns via role and/or nickname (only visible in this server) if you're comfortable doing so. Usernames and system tags need to be alphanumeric text (not emojis or special characters) for the benefit of screen readers. For those using PluralKit, we ask that you use the format `(headmate's name) (pronouns) | (system name)` in this server.
3. **Keep it wholesome, y‚Äôall** - Don't bash other streamers or their viewers. This is *not* space for flirting or finding people to hook up with, and you should only direct message folks in the server if you‚Äôve checked their DM role status or get *explicit* consent in a public space. You can add your direct message preferences from in ‚Å†üñ§role-menus.
4. **Respect the Mods** - Everyone in this chat has a right to feel safe and not crept on. If you feel like someone isn't respecting this right, please report them to the mods. Please be aware that moderators may contact you regardless of your direct message preferences.
5. **Politics or Religion** should be kept to the dedicated spaces for them. We honor the diversity of spirituality and religion on this server. Since human rights have become politicized, we also find it important to discuss occasionally.
6. **This server is part of Meowster‚Äôs living** - please ONLY advertise in #self-promotion, and don't post invites to other servers without an admin‚Äôs permission. While we believe in mutual aid and support, this is not the server to ask for financial aid. If you have something that you would like shared, please contact @Senior Discord Mod.
7. **Content Warnings** - Certain topics can provoke strong negative responses and content that could keep users from participating (illness, stressors, traumatic events, etc) are allowed but should always be hidden using a spoiler tag and marked with a content warning (CW). Nudes and porn are not allowed under any circumstances.
8. **Substance Use** - This server seeks to be comfy, cozy, and wholesome. Out of respect for folks recovering from substances, we request mentions or images of alcohol or substances that are usually considered recreational, even if they are being used medicinally, as well as states of inebriation be CWed and/or spoilered in all channels.
9. **18+ only** - This wholesome server is for folks 18+ years of age. (Keep in mind rule #3).

## Additional Info About This Server

**What We Stand For:** This is an intersectional-feminist, anti-racist, anti-fascist, trans-and-nonbinary-inclusive, queer-friendly, anti-ableist, plural-inclusive, sex-worker inclusive, anti-zionist, furry-inclusive, leftist community. We expect everyone here to follow these principles. **Discord is Not Secure:** Assume anything you post here could potentially be made public. While we do our best to keep this server safe and secure, we cannot guarantee it. **Compassionate Communication:** We use content warnings and spoilers, we want our community to avoid venting, sadposting, and casual oppression. (See ‚Å†üìúcommunity-values for more info).

*To anyone who is new to the server or new to discord, I invite you to consider muting channels that have topics you‚Äôre not as interested in to help cut down on overwhelm. I know that a lot of us here are neurodivergent and get overwhelmed by information and stimulus.*

*Please visit ‚Å†üñ§role-menus to pick up additional roles in the server! We love knowing peoples‚Äô pronouns and fave games.* 

## Content Warnings and Spoiler Tags

Hello folks, we‚Äôd like to implement a few things in this community in order to help keep everyone safe and avoid triggering any traumas that folks may have. In this spirit, we would like to ask everyone to please implement the usage of CW: tags (content warning tags) when mentioning things such as food, or anything that might be found traumatic or triggering in general. Food posting in the #food channel is exempt from content warnings.

As such, these rules and instructions have been added to the #server-rules channel:

## Content Warnings (CWs) and Spoilers

Certain topics can provoke strong negative responses, and content that could keep users from participating (e.g. illness, stressors, traumatic events, etc) are allowed but should always be hidden using a spoiler tag and marked with a content warning (CW). Nudes and porn are not allowed under any circumstances.

To hide text or a link to an image, use this format: (cw example) ||  Text or link  ||
To hide direct image uploads, you can check a box on the desktop and web clients. On mobile, rename the file to begin with SPOILER_

If you're not sure how to tag something, you're always welcome to ask any of the mods. Pay attention to how other people handle content and follow their example, and if someone asks you to spoiler tag something you posted, do so. Spoiler tags should never be used without a content warning, and should not be used for jokes, as these uses undermine their effectiveness in helping people decide whether to engage with hidden content. If you want to use a spoiler tag for a joke, please use ~~crossout~~ instead.

## Food Posting

Please keep the following things behind spoilers with appropriate content warnings (cw):
Images of food/drink where the focus is the food/drink (outside the food channel)
Long-form text on food (outside the food channel), for example, recipes or extended discussions about food.
Discussion of food restriction/dieting (spoiler and cw everywhere)
Discussion of weight, whether that be weight gain, weight loss, or just general weight talk (spoiler and cw everywhere)**

## Venting and Sadposting

While we recognize the need for folks to talk about things that are on their minds, that they find stressful, or otherwise could be considered ‚Äúsadposting‚Äù, we would request that those subjects be broached with consent, and with content warning tags so that anyone following up later may engage with potentially upsetting subjects only if they have the capacity and desire to do so. This is NOT a ‚Äúgood vibes only‚Äù space, you are welcome to feel all your feelings - just be aware of how that affects other people in the server. 

> **An Example:** 
>
> **Muiramme** ‚Äúhey, I‚Äôm having a down day, is it alright with folks if I share a little of what‚Äôs happening?‚Äù 
>
> **GenderMeowster** ‚ÄúSure, just remember to CW it please‚Äù 
>
> **Muiramme** Okay, thanks. 
>
> **Muiramme** cw: sad feelings, current events. 
> I‚Äôm really sad today because I‚Äôm missing my family and hugs and this pandemic SUUUUUCKS
>
> **GenderMeowster** I hear you. cw: current events pandemic sucks, I want to hug my friends and family too 

**Venting** - dropping in the problem and then leaving the channel and no longer engaging - is not allowed. If you ‚Äújust have to get something off my chest,‚Äù please tell your journal, punch a pillow/workout about it, or tell a trusted friend. We find this kind of discourse to ‚Äúsuck the air out of the room‚Äù and it can be awkward for others to know how to engage.

If you would like someone to lend their ear, it is recommended to ask in the general chat if anyone has the capacity, and to take that conversation (with consent) to DMs. Please respect that everyone has different levels of capacity at different times, and none of us are trained mental health professionals.

## Casual Oppression

We as a community are working to ensure that we're aware of ways in which we can be casually oppressive, and are doing our best to be a place where we encourage each other to be better. We will address events of casual oppression in a way that is non-punitive, and focused on the growth and well-being of every member of this server. 

We want to avoid exclusionary language. We‚Äôre going to discourage making negative or shaming comments of people based on perceived lack of intelligence or knowledge. We are also going to be discouraging fat-shaming, as well as shaming people based on appearances or atypical physical behaviors. There is a lot of hidden racism, sexism, and more in idioms and we encourage folks to research their language instead of assuming things are not oppressive. 

- Wild, overwhelming, perplexing, or surprising instead of crazy 
- Frustrating, infuriating, or underwhelming instead of dumb
- Y‚Äôall, folks, or this community/group instead of guys 
- Avoid appearance-based dunks fat, teeth, greasy hair, short, ‚Äúlook gay‚Äù

More here: http://web.augsburg.edu/english/writinglab/Avoiding_Ableist_Language.pdf

Due to how normalized casual oppression is, we know these are difficult habits to break, so there won‚Äôt be harsh consequences for anything that we wouldn‚Äôt have kicked or banned for before. We will, however, be kindly reminding folks that these are forms of casual oppression when they pop up and will encourage y‚Äôall to remind each other that we can do better.

This is a different approach to moderation than you might be used to since we‚Äôre asking the community to actively work together to break old habits. We know that getting a DM or a public channel message from a mod can be distressing, and we want to be sensitive to that. Not abiding by these guidelines will not be grounds for a ban, which is why they‚Äôre going to be listed outside of the formal server rules.

## COVID

As an additional point on our rules against ableism, know that the Clowder's understanding of COVID is: 
- COVID is not over
- Vaccines work
- Folks should still be wearing an n95-style mask (or better) to protect themselves and others, especially the immunocompromised among us.
Further information can be found in the ‚Å†üò∑covid-rsv-flu-talk channel

## Plurality

We welcome all types of plural systems and do not gatekeep who is plural.

For those using @PluralKit (which allows system members to post individually rather than obscured by a single nickname): please know that headmate entries must include the account or system name containing alphanumeric characters to accommodate screenreaders (pk;member <display name> servername <server display name>). PK is for use by plural systems only.
